## ðŸ‘‹ Hola! Welcome to my Gatsby Learn project

I've created this project to learn GatsbyJS and also build my Portfolio + Blog website (v1). I've used [Gatsby Starter Hello World](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) starter pack and built everything by referring to [tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

#### Design
I put together a basic design in Sketch that helped me have some personal goal (instead of just following dummy site building per the tutorial)
